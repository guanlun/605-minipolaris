The basic blocks are recognized based on the structural information of statements (predecessors, successors, previous statement and next statement).

If a statement has zero or more than one predecessors, it is the beginning of a new basic block.

If a statement has zero or more than one successors, or if its only successor is not the following statement (indicating a GOTO), it is then the ending of the current basic block.

The predecessors of each basic block are obtained by following the reference of the predecessor statements of its first statement. After finding what the predecessor statements are, query the work_stack of the statement to find the BasicBlockWork reference that has been added to the work_stack beforehand.

The successors of each basic block are obtained in a similar fashion.

A helper class BasicBlockWork is created as a container of a BasicBlock, and is added to a statement's work_stack to keep a reference from statements to basic blocks.
